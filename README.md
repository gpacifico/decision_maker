# The Decision Maker
## Like the Magic 8-Ball, except not

This app will help people make hard choices by having them answer a series of yes or no questions. Each yes or no answer has a
certain number of points attached to it, and based on the number of points reached by the end, the app will tell the user 
whether or not he or she should do the action in question.
